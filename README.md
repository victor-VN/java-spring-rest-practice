 > Why REST? REST embraces the precepts of the web, including its architecture, benefits, and everything else. <br>
 >  What benefits? The web and its core protocol, HTTP, provide a stack of features:
   >- Suitable actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, …​)
   >- Caching
   >- Redirection and forwarding
   >- Security (encryption and authentication)
